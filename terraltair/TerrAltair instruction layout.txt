TTbyte - a value from 0 to 999, which is less than the max 10 bit value (1024)

----------------------------------------------
----------------- THE LAYOUT -----------------
----------------------------------------------

-*-* MEMORY *-*-

the cpu has 7+1 registers in total
register 011 is the TTbyte located at M address of RAM

A   B   M   RAM X   Y   S   J
000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111

any may be used for mathematical, transfer or I/O operations

J defines the JMP location
S is used as the stack pointer for the cpu's stack instructions

(locations A and B are not the same thing as registers A and B!)

-*-* ALU and JMP *-*-

-* ALU *-

the answer is always stored in location A

0000 - add           A + B
0001 - sub           A - B

0010 - left shift    A << B
0011 - right shift   A >> B

0100 - multiply      A * B
0101 - divide        A / B

0110 - get remainder A % B
0111 - get ALU flags

[incomplete] 1000 - bitwise not   !A
[incomplete] 1001 - bitwise and   A & B

[incomplete] 1010 - bitwise or    A | B
[incomplete] 1011 - bitwise xor   A ^ B


1100, 1101, 1110 - unused

1111 - unused (should never be used to prevent TTbyte overflows)

-* ALU FLAGS *-
[incomplete]

"C" - carry
"Z" - equal to zero
"E" - even number
"N" - actual result is negative

000000CZEN

-* JMP *-

00 - no jump
01 - jump if equal to 0 (JZ)
10 - jump if not equal to 0 (JNZ)
11 - unconditional jump (JMP)

-*-* LAYOUT AND MODES OF OPERATION *-*-

"x" - useless bits

"M" - mode select

MM????????
??????????


"00" - data mode

"A" - location A
"B" - location B

if V = 0, transfer A <- B

"V" - load immediate value in A
"v" - value

"S" - enable stack manipulation
one of the locations must be 011 (RAM) for it to work properly

if location A is RAM, PUSH location B onto the stack
if location B is RAM, POP the stack into location A

if location A is RAM and V = 1, PUSH an immediate value onto the stack

vvvvvvvvvv


"01" - ALU / JMP mode

"A" - location A
"B" - location B

"o" - operation

"J" - jump conditions

when jumping, the calculation result is not applied to the target register

"V" - use a small direct value vvvvv

BBB is ignored if V = 1

01AAABBBJJ
ooooVvvvvv

if JJ = 11:

"D" - whether to direct jump or jump to M
"d" - direct jump address

01xxxxxD11
dddddddddd


"10" - I/O mode

"L" - location

"W" - whether to read/write (0/1) to the address
"a" - I/O address
"V" - write a value vvvvvvvv directly
"T" - throw away the value if reading

it's not useful to set both V and T to 1, as one will always be irrelevant. this helps avoid the TTbyte overflow

"C" - pass clock state

10LLLWCaaa
TVvvvvvvvv


"11" - cpu control

"H" - halt operation

"R" - reset cpu

does NOP (no operation) if no op bits are set
